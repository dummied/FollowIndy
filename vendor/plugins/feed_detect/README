FeedDetect
==========

This plugin intends to find those controller actions that respond_to atom or rss formats and adds a @feed_url variable to each call with the url to said feed.

It also has a +feed_tag+ view helper that will automatically stick in an auto discovery link if @feed_url is defined.
